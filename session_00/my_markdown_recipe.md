Delicious Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe
Ingredients

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

1 tsp baking soda

1 tsp salt

1 cup unsalted butter, softened

3/4 cup white sugar

3/4 cup brown sugar

2 large eggs

2 tsp vanilla extract

2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

In a separate large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth.

Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture, and beat until well combined.

Gradually mix in the flour mixture until just combined.

Fold in the chocolate chips.

Drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.

Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.

Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.

Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!
